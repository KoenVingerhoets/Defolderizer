# Defolderizer
An extremely basic form (that also embeds the actual code) to get certain or all files from subfolders into one main folder.
This thing was created originally around 2016-2017 to get pictures from a slew folders from a USB disk.
More recently, I started using it to get Tesla invoices from their subfolders after downloading these invoices for a month through the app.
